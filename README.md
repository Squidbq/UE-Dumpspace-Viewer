# Dumpspace Viewer

A modern desktop application for viewing, searching, and analyzing Unreal Engine dump data generated by [Dumper-7](https://github.com/Encryqed/Dumper-7). This tool provides an intuitive interface for exploring classes, structs, functions, enums, and offsets from Unreal Engine game dumps, with powerful search capabilities, inheritance visualization, and code generation features.

## What is This Project?

Dumpspace Viewer is designed to help developers and reverse engineers work with Unreal Engine dump data more efficiently. It takes JSON dump files generated by Dumper-7 and provides:

- **Fast Search**: Instantly search through thousands of classes, structs, functions, enums, and offsets
- **Inheritance Visualization**: Visualize and navigate class inheritance hierarchies
- **Code Generation**: Generate C++ and C# offset code for your projects
- **Collection Management**: Organize and manage offsets and members into collections
- **Advanced Member Search**: Search for members across inheritance chains and referenced types

Useful for modding, reverse engineering, and Unreal Engine development workflows.

## Features

- **Multi-type Search**: Search across Classes, Structs, Functions, Enums, and Offsets simultaneously
- **Type Search Mode**: Search by member type instead of member name
- **Inheritance Visualization**: View complete inheritance chains with clickable navigation
- **Inheritance Graph** (Beta): Interactive visual graph of class inheritance relationships
- **Code Generation**: Generate C++ and C# struct/offset code with proper formatting
- **Collection System**: Create and manage collections of offsets and members
- **Advanced Member Search**: Search members across parent/child classes and referenced types
- **Real-time Search**: Instant results as you type
- **Modern UI**: Dark theme with responsive design
- **File-based Storage**: Collections saved to file system

## Installation & Running

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js** 16+ and **npm**
- **Windows 10/11** (for built executable)

### Development Mode

1. Clone or download this repository

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

3. Run the application:
```bash
npm start
```

### Building for Windows

1. Install dependencies (if not already done):
```bash
npm install
```

2. Build the executable:
```bash
npm run build:win
```

The built application will be in the `dist` folder:
- **Installer**: `dist/Dumpspace Viewer Setup 1.0.0.exe` (NSIS installer)
- **Portable**: `dist/win-unpacked/Dumpspace Viewer.exe` (portable executable)

**Note**: To set a custom icon, place `build/icon.ico` in the project root before building.

## Usage

1. **Prepare Your Dump Files**: 
   - Use [Dumper-7](https://github.com/Encryqed/Dumper-7) to generate dump files from your Unreal Engine game
   - You'll need: `ClassesInfo.json`, `StructsInfo.json`, `FunctionsInfo.json`, `EnumsInfo.json`, `OffsetsInfo.json`

2. **Load Your Dumps**:
   - Launch the application
   - Click "Select Folder" and choose the directory containing your JSON dump files
   - The application will automatically load all JSON files

3. **Search & Explore**:
   - Use the search bar to find classes, structs, functions, enums, or offsets
   - Click on results to view detailed information
   - Navigate inheritance chains using the inheritance path display
   - Use the "Graph View" button to visualize inheritance (Beta feature)

4. **Generate Code**:
   - View classes/structs to see generated C++ code
   - Use the "Copy Code" button to copy to clipboard
   - Or use "Export to File" to save code to a file

5. **Manage Collections**:
   - Right-click on members to add them to collections
   - Create collections to organize offsets for your projects
   - Generate C++ or C# offset code from collections
   - Export/import collections for sharing

## Keyboard Shortcuts

- `Ctrl+F`: Focus search input
- `Ctrl+Shift+F`: Open global search modal
- `Escape`: Close detail panel or modals
- `Back/Forward`: Navigate through history (if available)

## Mouse Navigation

- **Mouse Back Button** (Button 4): Navigate back through history
- **Mouse Forward Button** (Button 5): Navigate forward through history

## Beta Features

### Inheritance Graph (Beta)

The inheritance graph visualization is currently in **beta** and is **unstable**. It provides an interactive visual representation of class inheritance relationships. Features may be limited or subject to change.

**⚠️ Warning**: This feature is currently unstable and can consume **gigabytes of memory** when viewing large files with many members/variables, potentially causing the program to crash. Use with caution, especially on large dump files.

To access:
1. View a class or struct
2. Click the "Graph View" button in the inheritance path section
3. Explore the interactive graph (zoom, pan, click nodes to navigate)
